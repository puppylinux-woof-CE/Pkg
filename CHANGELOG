1.9.18
- fixed: syntax error in /etc/bash_completion.d/pkg
- fixed: 'what-needs' option was missing from list of cmds in --usage output
- fixed: list deps, install/uninstall pkg on xenialpup (ubuntu based)


1.9.17
- new: allow override default rc file location (~/.pkg/pkgrc) with $PKGRC env var 
- new: `pkg --what-needs PKGNAME`, list the pkgs that depend on PKGNAME .. (reverse dep lookup)
- fixed pkg_install(): clean up .csh files post install, silence output of 'glib-compile-schemas' and 'gio-querymodules'
- fixed pkg_build(): add error message when trying to build pkg that doesn't exist (using petbuild)
- fixed list_build_scripts(): dont output empty lines
- fixed list_dependants(): also list builtins if HIDE_BUILTINS=false
- fixed find_deps(): remove builtins from list unless HIDE_BUILTINS=false
- fixed list_deps(): 
	- (some code moved to find_deps(), see above)
	- by default --list-deps will list installed deps too, as in earlier versions 
	- sometimes pkg was listed as it's own dep, now fixed
- fixed get_pkg_name_only(), more accurate
- fixed get_deps(): fixed failure to install some already downloaded packages
- fixed pkg_entry(): can now get pkg repo entries from any repo, not only current, also doesn't need full pkg name
- fixed print_usage(): 
	`pkg --usage <option>`
	- added support for short options (-li,-pi,-ps,-ld,-le, etc)
	- added usage info for the various supported environment vars
	- added example cmds to usage output of given cmd, taken from /usr/lib/pkg/docs/examples.txt
	- added info about seeing current setting if no options given for some cmds
	- cleanup: sources files in /usr/lib/pkg/docs/usage/* all contain USAGE="", can be sourced properly
	- fixed usage info of `pkg --add-source`
	- fixed usage info of `pkg --dir2pet`, added more complete pet.specs example
- cleanup: better cleanup of tmp files in firstrun(), called by --welcome cmd


1.9.16
- added option: `pkg --welcome` invokes first_run(), prints welcome screen with helpful tips
- improvement: `pkg -la` (delete all pkgs in WORKDIR) will confirm before deleting all pkgs
- small fixes, clean ups and updates in man page, README, help text.
- fixed: create layers-installed [inc devx pkgs if devx loaded] on Pkg load
    * this also helps removes PetGet as a dependency of Pkg
- cleanup: always use $HOME not '/root' (except when trying to fix missing repo files on first run)
    * Pkg should work better when users $HOME dir not /root 
- fixed list_installed_pkgs(): 
    * if called with -li, list only user installed pkgs (same as PetGet)
    * if called with -LI, list all installed pkgs inc builtins [and devx pkgs]
- cleanup: replace all `expr 2 + 2` with $((2 + 2)) (ash supports it going way back, I think)
- cleanup and improvements in hide_installed_pkgs_from_search_results():
    * fixes in using HIDE_INSTALLED - does its job more accurately, less code
- update: Gpkgdialog 0.4: includes fixes for listing of repo pkgs without installed pkgs
- update: Pkgdialog 0.6:
    * new: call as Xpkgdialog to use the Xdialog interface
    * speedup: set LANG=C for whole script (and set LANG back to prev value at end)
    * speedup: now using ash, not bash (Search All can still be really sloooow)
    * nicer styling, removed box shadows, bigger menus
    * fixed: updated some labels on exit and cancel buttons
    * fixed: allow override of HIDE_INSTALLED.. Usage: `HIDE_INSTALLED=true|false pkgdialog`
    * fixed: use --textbox to show help info and current settings config
    * various fixes to menu navigation in following sections:
	- fixed: use a --tailbox when installing/removing/updating/converting/combining pkgs
	- fixed: ask to install/uninstall pkg(s) after pkg selection in 'Search' and 'Downloaded'
	- fixed: ask to uninstall pkg(s) after pkg selection in 'Installed'
	- fixed: get pkg lists for combine/convert pkgs


1.9.15
- added msg about enabling TAB auto-completion if not enabled
- added option: `pkg --no-colour|--no-color|-nc` .. an easier way to disable colours
    * added usage info in /usr/lib/pkg/docs/usage/no-colour
    * do `pkg -usage no-colour`
- cleanup: simpler creation of WORKDIR, simpler exit if fail to find WORKDIR
- cleanup: when finding avail repos on first run (see 'final checks' section)
- fixed: was missing usage help info for `--pkg-entry`
- improvements in CLI interface, more robust, more programmable:
    * supports passing multiple PKGs to most options, with or without quotes
    * PKGs can be delimited (separated) by space, comma (or a pipe when in quotes)
    * you can still pipe (newline or space delimited) lists into Pkg if you give dash (-) as its last option:
	example: `echo geany vlc | pkg -PS -` will print status of both pkgs
    * if piping stuff, use -ss and -ssa for pipe-able search output (-s and -s produce fancy ouput)
- fixed: include devx pkgs in `pkg -LI`, which should list ALL installed pkgs
- fixes in finding where pkg comes from: 
    * same fixes applied to: is_usr_pkg(), is_devx_pkg(), is_builtin_pkg(), is_repo_pkg(), is_installed_pkg()
- fixed repo_file_list(): takes repo name returns name of its repo file,
    * fixed a failure to return the correct, matching repo file in some cases
- fixes in pkg_status(): 
    * show correct install status (user,devx,builtin,layers)
    * fixed missing repo filenames (see repo_file_list)
    * standardise output: add 'K' to end of $pkg_size, if not already there



1.9.14
- fixed list_dependants(): don't include the pkg being checked in the list, only its dependants
- fix pkg_download(): nicer output when using --ask
    * if not called with --ask, then always hide question tags
    * this fixes internal funcs calls where Pkg disables $ASK internally, but user gave --ask option
- fix pkg_combine(): fixed some breaking changes from last version, added support for --ask and including BUILTINS
    * Use  `pkg --pkg-combine|-pc`  to combine a pkg with its deps, not including builtins.
    * Prefix above cmd with  HIDE_BUILTINS=false  to include builtins too
    * fixed: use --ask and Pkg will ask which pkgs to put into the final PET/SFS
- fixes in pkg_install(): better checking local files before install
- fixes in pkg_get(): works better when --force and --ask used together
    * dont error if user chooses to skip a download in the loop
- fixed pkg_update(): dont search or update builtin pkgs, unless  HIDE_BUILTINS=false  given
- cleanup naming of functions, more consistent
- cleanup CLI interace: fixed usage msgs not showing, fixed opts not accepting multiple pkgs
- cleanup code, moved help info to /usr/lib/pkg/docs/, source it in Pkg
- much nicer usage info: moved into /usr/lib/pkg/docs/usage/<cmd_name>
    * give cmd (--get, --download, etc) without options to see its usage info
    * or use `pkg --usage|-usage [CMD]` to see list or usage of available commands

1.9.13
- added entries for Zesty repos to sources-all (not tested)
- added --autoclean option: auto-delete pkg files after they've been installed
	# use  `pkg --autoclean [yes|no]` (defaut is no)
- cleanup, renamed some funcs, 
- fixes in various funcs to better support Pkgs ENV vars
- fixed download_pkg() not finding the pkg to download in current repo
- fixed call get_pkg() with full pkgname from get_deps()
- fixed get_deps() output messages, better ordered
- fixed various funcs: loop over pkgs and deps, dont skip or exit at the wrong time
- fixes when using --force option:
    # --force will list all deps, inc builtins
    # --force will re-download all pkgs, except builtins (by default)
    # --force will re-install all pkgs,  except builtins (by default)
    # --force will not install or uninstall builtins (that is coming soon..)

1.9.12
- fixes in searches using pkg aliases 
- fixes in is_local_pkg(), more reliable
- fixes in pkg_contents(), better at looking for WORKDIR/PKGNAME when not in WORKDIR

- fixes in deb2pet(), now works better, cleaned up, uses the pkg_unpack() func
- fixed `pkg -go pkgname`: dont install pkgs, just download them
- fixed `pkg -PS pkgname`: lists deps sorted by missing/installed, more detailed than `pkg -ps pkgname`
- fixed `pkg --deps-check PKGNAME`: runs ldd on PKGNAME (must be an installed pkg) and prints msg about missing libs
- fixed TAB completion for --all-pkgs option
- fixes in RC files: use noarch repo on first run. See /etc/pkg/* and in ~/.pkg/*
- added new URLs for Trusty, Lucid and Precise repos: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
- added `pkg -pkg-entry PKGNAME`: list repo entry of pkg, each field on new line
- updated --list-deps,--list-installed: 
    # --list-deps default behaviour is still to "list all deps of pkg (not inc builtins)"
    # --list-installed default behaviour is still to "list all installed pkgs (not inc builtins)"
    # but they now support the env vars: HIDE_USER_PKGS, HIDE_BUILTINS [true or false] .. 
    # Pkg users can use these in combination to show all, only missing, already builtin, etc
    # EG:
     HIDE_USER_PKGS=true  HIDE_BUILTINS=true  pkg -le PKGNAME	# list only deps not yet installed:
     HIDE_USER_PKGS=true  HIDE_BUILTINS=false pkg -le PKGNAME   # list only the deps of PKGNAME that are already built in
     HIDE_USER_PKGS=false HIDE_BUILTINS=false pkg -le PKGNAME 	# list all deps of PKGNAME (as listed in its repo, inc builtins)
     HIDE_USER_PKGS=false HIDE_BUILTINS=false pkg -li PKGNAME 	# list all installed pkgs, inc builtins
     ...etc
- added `pkg -LE pkgname`: lists all deps, including builtins
- added `pkg -LI pkgname`: lists all installed pkgs, including builtins
- added the new capitalised options to help info [--help|-h|-H]
- added "NO_INSTALL" env var: replaces DEPINSTALL, GETINSTALL.. used by --get-only, --deps-download, others

- fixes in get_pkg(), only install if pkg contents can be listed by pkg_contents()
- fixed a 'not getting deps properly' regression (I think)
- fixes in is_installed_pkg(), more accurate, fewer checks

- fixed unpack_pkg(): 	extract SFS files to current dir
- fixed pkg_contents(): fixed a typo that would prevent skipping the loop

- fix pkg_repack(), add build number to created PET
	# get build number from pkgs repo entry, increment it, add to end of pkg name
- fixes in get_pkg_name()
	# make sure to search user installed pkgs first
	# this fixes finding names of pkgs that were installed over builtins

1.9.3

- fixed default settings in rc file: 
   # fix prevent correct dep search in first run 
   # updated, DEPSEARCH='list_all_pkg_names' by default 
    
- fixes in dep resolution: 
   # much faster, less looping, checks fewer deps, more reliable: 
   # now filtering out installed pkgs in find_deps() and list_deps() all in one go 
   # so `pkg --list-deps PKGNAME` now lists missing deps, not all deps. 
   # the same for `pkg --pkg-status PKGNAME` .. only lists missing deps
